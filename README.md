## 🎯 Problem Statement

Heart disease cases are increasing rapidly among young adults in India, especially in smaller cities where regular medical checkups are often expensive and difficult to access. Early awareness and preventive guidance are critical.

**HealthCare+** aims to provide early cardiac risk screening along with basic lifestyle guidance through a simple and accessible web platform.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

HealthCare+ uses Machine Learning to analyze **13 physiological health parameters** and predict heart health status. Based on the prediction, the system provides **personalized diet and lifestyle recommendations**.
